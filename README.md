# Expected-Credit-Loss-Modelling-in-Python
Modeling PD, LGD, EAD

This Credit Risk Modeling showcase largely follows the Credit Risk Modeling in Python course on Udemy.
https://www.udemy.com/course/credit-risk-modeling-in-python/

These code files divert from the course in terms of:
1- code used to achieve different purposes
2- regression algorithms to estimate EAD
3- different libraries are used for logistic and linear regression
